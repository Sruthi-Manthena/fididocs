## Continuous Integration (CI) Checks

8. As part of the pull request process, DotSight's CI system will run various checks and tests on your code. Ensure that all CI checks pass successfully before your pull request can be merged.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

9. Please make sure your pull requests come with sufficient unit test coverage to ensure the stability and reliability of your changes.

10. For any new class logic and functions you add, include corresponding unit tests under the `.spec.ts` files. These tests should cover different scenarios and edge cases to validate the correctness of your code.

11. Validate the test coverage by running the following command:
    ```shell
    npm run test:cov
    ```
