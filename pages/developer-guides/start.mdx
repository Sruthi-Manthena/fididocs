# DotSight Starter Guide

## *Pre-requisites*

### Node.js and npm Installation:
   - Ensure that you have Node.js version 16 or above installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed as well. Verify the version using `npm -v` and upgrade it to version 7 or above if needed: `npm install -g npm@7`.

### Docker Installation:
   - Install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Make sure you have Docker version 20 or above.

## *Cloning DotSight Repository*

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DotSight.git
```

Replace "your-username" with your GitHub username.

## *Installing Dependencies*

Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal:

```bash
cd DotSight
```

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm ci
```

## *Specifying Application Secrets*

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your desired values:

```plaintext
DB_NAME=dotsight
DB_USERNAME=dotsight
DB_PASSWORD=d0tS1gHtRul3z
```

## *Starting the Environment with Docker*

Start the environment by running Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## *Handling Port Allocation Error*

If you encounter a "Bind for 0.0.0.0:5433 failed: port is already allocated" error, ensure no other applications are using port 5433.

If you encounter any other errors, perform cleanup by running:

```bash
docker compose rm -f
```

Start the process again.

## *Populating the Database*

Run all migrations to populate the database:

```bash
npm run typeorm:run-migrations
```

## *Initiating DotSight Application*

Finally, initiate the DotSight application:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the application, and you should see relevant logs indicating that the server is running.

By following these steps, you should have successfully set up the DotSight application with all its dependencies and started the environment using Docker.
